# Enable-Cross-Region-Backup-Replication-for-EC2-using-AWS-Backup

#ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project demonstrates how to configure an AWS Backup Plan to automatically back up an EC2 instance in one region (ap-south-1) and replicate the backups to another region (ap-northeast-3).
This setup ensures data durability, disaster recovery, and resilience across geographically separated environments.
